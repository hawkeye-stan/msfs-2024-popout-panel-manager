## Version 0.1.0.0 Beta
Initial beta release for MSFS 2024

The following items do not work:
* Auto Pop Out. My community plugin "ready-to-fly-button-skipper" to skip the "Ready to Fly" screen no longer works. You will need to manually click "Ready to Fly" to initiate auto pop out. You can set the auto pop out delay in preference setting depending on the speed of your computer.
* DynamicLOD. No longer works. Option is removed for now. Since MSFS 2024 has dynamic FPS adjustment built-in, DynamicLOD or app like AutoFPS may not be needed?
