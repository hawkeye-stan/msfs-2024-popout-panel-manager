## Version 0.1.0.0

Initial beta release for MSFS 2024

The following items do not work:
- Auto Pop Out. My community plugin ready-to-fly-button-skipper to skip the "Ready to Fly" screen no longer works.
- Aircraft binding to profile. MSFS 2024 probably changed how aircraft information is defined. I've disable auto binding for now.
