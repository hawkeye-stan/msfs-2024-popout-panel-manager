## Version 0.1.1.0

* Fixed - pop out panels closed unexpectedly when entering pause screen or entering menu screen to adjust game settings.
* Fixed - when minimized into tray icon, app failed to reopen after double click tray icon. Also added an "Open" command to the tray icon right click menu to reopen app.
* Added - manual instruction to modified MSFS game file to allow auto pop out to work.
* Removed - Power on panel for G1000 aircraft for cold and dark option. This bug had been fixed for MSFS 2024. POPM work around is no longer needed.
* Removed - DynamicLOD option removed since code no longer works with MSFS 2024.
