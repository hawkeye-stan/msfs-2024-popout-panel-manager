# MSFS Pop Out Panel Manager 2024

MSFS Pop Out Panel Manager 2024 is an application for upcoming Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 that is set to be released in November 2024. It helps pop out, save and position pop out panels to be used by utilities such as Sim Innovations Air Manager or to place pop out panels onto your screen or another monitor at predetermined locations automatically. It also adds touch capability to pop out panels that are operated on touch screen which is currently not supported by the game.

The code based is based on MSFS Pop Out Panel Manager (for MSFS 2020). Still waiting for the following to be released by Microsoft/Asobo in order to complete development of initial version.

- Release of the actual game
- Release of updated MSFS 2024 development SDK

### Note: this project code does not work and is a skeleton code structure and a POC based on the limited Tech alpha testing during the weekend of Oct 12, 2024. Also, trying to help Asobo to get their telemetry data and do some actual flying over this weekend.

## App Release schedule

## Note: No guarantee! But I try hard to do a beta release if 
- the functionality gap between MSFS 2020 and MSFS 2024 is not massive
- all necessary SDK is released and I'm able to get it working
- I'm able to get the game installed and running during the mad rush when everybody is trying to download the game on November 19
