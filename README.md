# MSFS Pop Out Panel Manager 2024

MSFS Pop Out Panel Manager 2024 is an application for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. It helps pop out, save and position pop out panels to be used by utilities such as Sim Innovations Air Manager or to place pop out panels onto your screen or another monitor at predetermined locations automatically. It also adds touch capability to pop out panels that are operated on touch screen which is currently not supported by the game.

## Note: POPM functionality that does not work with MSFS 2024
- Auto Pop Out 
  -- My community plugin "ready-to-fly-button-skipper" to skip the "Ready to Fly" screen no longer works. You will need to manually click "Ready to Fly" to initiate auto pop out. You can set the auto pop out delay in preference setting depending on the speed of your computer.
- DynamicLOD
  -- No longer works. Option removed for now. Since MSFS 2024 has dynamic FPS adjustment built-in, DynamicLOD or app like AutoFPS may not be needed?
- Possible bugs and hopefully they do not affect POPM main functionality.
